# Sidney Ferreira's Resume #

### ME ###

I'm Sidney Ferreira, I've been working with development a long time ago. 
I started at 16 when a friend of mine told about "Programming Logics" course.
Since then I "sold my soul" for computers :laughing:

I'm a self starter and self-taught, almost everything I work I learned by my self. Including english, PHP and Android.
But I still humble: time to time I look for courses to polish my knowledge.

### Looking For ###

I love PHP, JavaScript, Mobile and many other things. And IMHO a developer must love to develop, whatever the language it is (it took some time to learn that sadly). That's why it's hard to limit what I'm looking for. So:

I would like to work with FrontEnd because I love to learn about UX and make beautiful UI

I would like to work with BackEnd beacuse I like to know the project from top to bottom, that's the only way you make a solid API

I'm open to some other positions too because I love to learn. 

The point is: if you work with a nice team, with nice people, you can work your way to be happy.
