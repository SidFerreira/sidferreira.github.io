### About me ###

I'm Sidney Ferreira, I've been a developer a long time now. 
I started at 16 when a friend of mine told me about a "Programming Logics" course.
Since then I "sold my soul" for computers :D

I'm a self starter and self-taught, almost everything I work I learned by myself. Including english, PHP and Android.
But I'm still humble: from time to time I look for courses to polish my knowledge.

### Looking for ###
I love PHP, JavaScript, Mobile and many other things. And IMHO a developer must love to develop, whatever the language and technology it is. That's why it's hard to limit what I'm looking for. So I describe my self as a full stack developer looking for a great team, with nice people, being not just a freelancer but a web-coworker :)

I love both Front-end and Back-end. The nice part about Front-end is to make great looking experiences. The nice part about Back-end? Well, make the magic happen!

    * Details: This is a huge portal we developer over a whole year. One of the requests was that the portal had distributed installs (one for each department) but they wanted to have a way that one install could fetch posts from other installs, including thumbnails, metadata, etc. We developed a custom WP Query for that. Also we created a Widget plugin so users could fetch the information and display in any way they wanted. We even had a (styleguide)[http://styleguide.adventistas.org/pt/] for other developers. Everything was developed as Plugins or Generic themes, so users could extend the themes the way they wanted
