### Bio

I'm Sidney Ferreira, I've been a developer a long time now (more than 10 years professionally). 
I started at 16 when a friend of mine told me about a "Programming Logics" course.
Since then I "sold my soul" for computers :D

I'm a self starter and quick learner... Almost everything I work I learned by myself. Including english, PHP and Android.
But I'm still humble: from time to time I look for courses to polish my knowledge and I'm always open to learn something new.

    * This is a huge WordPress portal we developed over a whole year. One of the requests was that the portal had distributed installs (one for each department) but they wanted to have a way that one install could fetch posts from other installs, including thumbnails, metadata, also dynamic column contents. Hosted on AWS using Beanstalk, Nginx, Git deploy
    * IASD Styleguide: (http://styleguide.adventistas.org/pt/) was a complex and detailed guide we used to display the contents on the website.
    * IASD_Query: WP_Query customization. It allow the sites to copy posts from each other. This was the engine for the MultiPost Widget. The information shared included thumbs and post metadata. While working in the project, I was able to keep 99% code coverage.
    * MultiPost Widget: This widget is the heart of the system. It would allow to pick one of the widgets from the style guide and customize column size (4/8/12), source (which site), frequency to fetch, reorder, post type, and other details.
